Hello! Iâ€™m Swapnil Revankar. This site serves my blog, where I share my technical experience in articles and tutorials as well as random thoughts.

Iâ€™m a character technical director with over 10 years of experience in rigging, technical art, tools and pipeline programming. I worked on several projects in 3D animation, mobile games , AR & VR experiences. Currently I am the Lead Technical Artist at StatusPro working on VR gaming title . Computer graphics and innovative technology is something Iâ€™m passionate about.

When Iâ€™m not on a computer, Iâ€™m probably playing with my dogs ðŸ˜‰
