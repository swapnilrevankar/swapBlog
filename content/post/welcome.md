After more than a decade of immersing myself in the world of CG and gaming, I have finally made the decision to start my own blog. This space will serve as a platform for my personal growth, allowing me to make incremental changes and improvements every single day. Inspired by the timeless principle that "the best way to learn something is to teach it," I aim to share my insights, observations, and experiences with the wider community. Join me on this exciting journey of exploration as I delve into industry trends, machine learning, art, games, characters, rigging, mathematics, and much more.
