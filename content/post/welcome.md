After spending more than 10 years in the CG and Gaming industry, I finally decided to start my own blog :smile:

My goal honestly is continuous self improvement, making small changes and improvements everyday.
There is a well known principle "The best way to learn something is to teach it" so that's what I wanna try and do here.
This website will be my space to pause and reflect, figure out skills that I wanna learn and improve. So I will talk more about industry trends, machine learning, art, games, characters, rigging, math, etc.
